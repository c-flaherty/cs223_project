Colin and I worked on a project that aimed to visualize the Ford Fulkerson max flow algorithm. In the process we thought
deeply about appropriate data structures for graphs and networks, implementing the algorithm itself, and about how to
make the visualization user friendly, instructive, and intuitive. 

For the network we decided on a Dict of Dict's for the adjacency matrix, and a source String and sink String, all packaged within a record. For this we made extensive use of the Dict library in Elm.
